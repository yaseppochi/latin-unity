;;; Commentary:

;; Mule bogusly considers the various ISO-8859 extended character sets
;; as disjoint, when ISO 8859 itself clearly considers them to be subsets
;; of a larger character set.  This library provides functions which
;; determine the list of coding systems which can encode all of the
;; characters in the buffer.

;; Provides the 'iso-8859-15 coding system if yet undefined.
;; #### Get the final byte for 'iso-8859-16 and do it too.

;;; Code:

(provide 'latin-unity)


;;; Requires
;; Do NOT require latin-unity-utils; that requires Mule-UCS.

;;
;; The basic algorithm is to map over the region, compute the set of

;;
;; The current implementation takes advantage of the fact that ASCII
;; characters are common and cannot change asciisets.  Then using
;; skip-chars-forward makes motion over ASCII subregions very fast.
;;
;; This same strategy could be applied generally by precomputing classes
;; of characters equivalent according to their effect on latinsets, and
;; adding a whole class to the skip-chars-forward string once a member is
;; found.
;;
;; Probably efficiency is a function of the number of characters matched,
;; or maybe the length of the match string?  With "skip-category-forward"
;; over a precomputed category table it should be really fast.  In practice
;; for Latin character sets there are only 29 classes.

Page down for more information on coding systems:

utf-8, iso-2022-7, and ctext support all characters safely.  iso-2022-7 and
ctext are ISO 2022 conforming coding systems for 7-bit and 8-bit environments
respectively.  Be careful, there is a lot of software that does not understand
them.  utf-8 (Unicode) may also be unsupported in some environments, but they
are becoming fewer all the time.  utf-8 is recommended if usable (except for
some users of Asian ideographs who need to mix languages).

In Mule, most iso-* coding systems are capable of encoding all characters.
However, characters outside of the normal range for the coding system require
use of ISO 2022 extension techniques and is likely to be unsupported by other
software, including software that supports iso-2022-7 or ctext.

characters you want changed, and which should be left alone.

Another way to accomplish this, but using coding systems rather than character
sets to specify the desired recoding, is `latin-unity-recode-coding-region'.
That function may be faster but is somewhat more dangerous, because it may
recode more than one character set.

To change from one Mule representation to another without changing identity
of any characters, use `latin-unity-remap-region'."

  "Remap characters between BEGIN and END to equivalents in CHARACTER-SET.
Optional argument CODING-SYSTEM may be a coding system name (a symbol) or
nil.  Characters with no equivalent are left as-is.

When called interactively, BEGIN and END are set to the beginning and
end, respectively, of the active region, and XEmacs prompts for
CHARACTER-SET.

Return CODING-SYSTEM if CODING-SYSTEM can encode all characters in the
region, t if CODING-SYSTEM is nil and the coding system with G0 = 'ascii
and G1 = CHARACTER-SET can encode all characters, and otherwise nil.  Note
that a non-null return does _not_ mean it is safe to write the file, only
the specified region.  (This behavior is useful for multipart MIME encoding
and the like.)

Interactively BEGIN and END are set to the current region and the function
prompts for CHARACTER-SET.  There is no way to specify CODING-SYSTEM, as it
has no useful function interactively.

Note:  by default this function is quite fascist about universal coding
systems.  It only admits utf-8, iso-2022-7, and ctext.  Customize
`latin-unity-ucs-list' to change this.

This function remaps characters that are artificially distinguished by Mule
internal code.  It may change the code point as well as the character set.

`latin-unity-recode-region'."
