;;; Commentary:

;; Mule bogusly considers the various ISO-8859 extended character sets
;; as disjoint, when ISO 8859 itself clearly considers them to be subsets
;; of a larger character set.  This library provides functions which
;; determine the list of coding systems which can encode all of the
;; characters in the buffer.

;; Provides the 'iso-8859-13 and 'iso-8859-15 coding systems if undefined.

;;; Code:

(provide 'latin-unity)


;;; Requires

(require 'latin-unity-vars)

(if (or (fboundp 'character-to-unicode)	; XEmacs  post-21.5.5
	(fboundp 'char-to-ucs))		; Mule-UCS already loaded

(defcustom latin-unity-preapproved-coding-system-list
  '(buffer-default preferred)
  "*List of coding systems used without querying the user if feasible.

The first feasible coding system in this list is used.  The special values
'preferred and 'buffer-default may be present:

  buffer-default  Use the coding system used by `write-region', if feasible.
  preferred       Use the coding system specified by `prefer-coding-system'
                  if feasible.

\"Feasible\" means that all characters in the buffer can be represented by
the coding system.  Coding systems in `latin-unity-ucs-list' are always
considered feasible.  Other feasible coding systems are computed by
`latin-unity-representations-feasible-region'.

Most users will want at least one ISO 8859 coding system in this list, as
otherwise pure ASCII files will not be preapproved.  (This is a bug, due
to the limitation of applicability of this package to Latin and universal.
The condition that an ISO 8859 coding system be included will be satisfied
implicitly by 'buffer-default or 'preferred for most users, but it can be
annoying for users of ISO 2022 or EUC coding systems.)

Note that the first universal coding system in this list shadows all other
coding systems.  In particular, if your preferred coding system is a universal
coding system, and 'preferred is a member of this list, latin-unity will
blithely convert all your files to that coding system.  This is considered a
feature, but it may surprise most users.  Users who don't like this behavior
should move 'preferred to `latin-unity-preferred-coding-system-list'."

Order matters; coding systems earlier in the list will be preferred

`latin-unity-preapproved-coding-system-list'), and follow the
`latin-unity-preferred-coding-system-list' in the list of suggested

this list will be the default.

Notes on certain coding systems:  If `escape-quoted' is not a member of
this list, you will be unable to autosave files or byte-compile Mule
Lisp files.

latin-unity does not try to be \"smart\" about general ISO 2022 coding
systems, such as ISO-2022-JP.  (They are not recognized as equivalent
to `iso-2022-7'.)  If your preferred coding system is one of these,
consider adding it to `latin-unity-ucs-list'.  However, this will
typically have the side effect that (eg) ISO 8859/1 files will be
saved in 7-bit form with ISO 2022 escape sequences."

;; The basic algorithm is to map over the region, compute the set of
;; charsets that can represent each character (the "feasible charset"),

;;
;; The current implementation takes advantage of the fact that ASCII
;; characters are common and cannot change asciisets.  Then using
;; skip-chars-forward makes motion over ASCII subregions very fast.
;;
;; Easy optimizations would be to (1) append observed characters to the
;; characters-to-skip string, and (2) to fail immediately on detection of
;; a non-Latin character.  (Avoid kludgy implementations of (2) which don't
;; admit generalization as we add more character sets to unify.)
;;
;; This same strategy could be applied generally by precomputing classes
;; of characters equivalent according to their effect on latinsets, and
;; adding a whole class to the skip-chars-forward string once a member is
;; found.
;;
;; Probably efficiency is a function of the number of characters matched,
;; or maybe the length of the match string?  With "skip-category-forward"
;; over a precomputed category table it should be really fast.  In practice
;; for Latin character sets there are only 29 classes.

Page down for more information on coding systems:

utf-8, iso-2022-7, and ctext support all characters safely.  iso-2022-7 and
ctext are ISO 2022 conforming coding systems for 7-bit and 8-bit environments
respectively.  Be careful, there is a lot of software that does not understand
them.  utf-8 (Unicode) may also be unsupported in some environments, but they
are becoming fewer all the time.  utf-8 is recommended if usable (except for
some users of Asian ideographs who need to mix languages).

In Mule, most iso-* coding systems are capable of encoding all characters.
However, characters outside of the normal range for the coding system require
use of ISO 2022 extension techniques and is likely to be unsupported by other
software, including software that supports iso-2022-7 or ctext.

By deleting various portions of the buffer and saving, or by setq'ing
buffer-file-coding-system and saving, you can see how the thing works.
After compiling and loading the file, do (by hand)

M-: (latin-unity-install) RET.

To see a trace of what it's doing (you need to read the code to interpret),
to get more information about character sets in the region, and to enable
some sledgehammer error checks

M-: (setq latin-unity-debug t) RET

To disable the hook, do

M-: (latin-unity-uninstall) RET.

Note:  the *install functions are interactive---you can execute with M-x.
I wrote them as above so you can C-x C-e them in this buffer.
