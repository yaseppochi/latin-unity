Mule bogusly considers the various ISO-8859 extended character sets as
disjoint, when ISO 8859 itself clearly considers them to be subsets of
a larger character set.  This package provides functions which
determine the list of coding systems which can encode all of the
characters in the buffer, and translate to a common coding system.
