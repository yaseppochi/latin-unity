latin-unity

Mule bogusly considers the various ISO-8859 extended character sets as
disjoint, when ISO 8859 itself clearly considers them to be subsets of
a larger character set.  This package provides functions to determine
the list of coding systems which can encode all of the characters in
the buffer, and translate to a common coding system.  It also provides
Latin-9 charset, coding system, and input method.
